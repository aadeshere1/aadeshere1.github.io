# Cloudflare

Cloudflare, is an U.S. company which provides a content delivery network, internet security services, and distributed DNS services. It sits between visitor and Cloudflare user's hosting provider, acting as a reverse proxy for websites. The use of Cloudflare results in network security, fast page load, availability of sites for mobile.

I'd like to show you how I use DNS service provided by Cloudflare with my domain names. First you have to have a domain name registered and a [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) account. Now to add site with cloudflare, follow the given steps:

**Step 1: [Setup](https://www.cloudflare.com/a/setup)**
It will take about one minute to scan DNS records of your site.

**Step 2: Setup the CNAME, A records for your site** | Example: I'm using A records to point to github as I'm using github hosting.
