Have you ever wondered whether ruby has one liner server command equivalent to the python ?
Turns out there is a similar command for ruby also.

Open your terminal, go to your desired directory where you want to run the server and enter the following:

``` ruby
ruby -run -e httpd . -p 5000
```

It will start a webserver runnning on your machine at port 5000. No extra gem is needed for this to run.
