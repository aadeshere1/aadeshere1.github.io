title: How to install Ruby on Linux

We will be setting up Ruby development environment on Ubuntu 16.04.

Since Ubuntu is one of the easiest linux distribution and is used by many people, we will start with it.

### Installing Ruby
Step 1: Install dependencies for Ruby

{% highlight bash%}
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git-core curl zlib1g-dev build-essential
libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3
libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev python-software-properties
libffi-dev
{% endhighlight %}

We will use ```rbenv``` for setting up the environment. For this we will have to setup rbenv first.

``` bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL

git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL

git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-gem-rehash.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/rbenv-gem-rehash

rbenv install 2.3.0
rbenv global 2.3.0
ruby -v
```

Then we need to install the bundler which is basically a ruby gem.

```bash
gem install bundler
```

```bash
rbenv rehash
```

Now, run ```which ruby``` in the terminal to check whether ruby has been installed or not. If ruby is successfully installed then, ```/home/{username}/.rbenv/shims/ruby``` will be returned.
