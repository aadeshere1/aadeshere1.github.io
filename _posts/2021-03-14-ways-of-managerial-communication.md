Usually, there are three ways through which managers communicate amongst themselves and with their subordinates. 

## Verbal Communication
Communication done with the help of words is called verbal communication. In verbal communication, individuals need to be very careful about their speech. They have to be loud and clear while interacting with employees at the workplace.

## Written Communication
Communication done through written records like emails, letters, notices and so on. Most important ideas and documentation are done through written communication so that everyone can refer back to it in future.
