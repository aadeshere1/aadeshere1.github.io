The 7 C's of Effective Communication are as follows.

1. Clarity (nov vague)
2. Conciseness (short, simple and brief) - brevity is the key to effective communication
3. Completeness (well-connected thoughts in the form of sentences)
4. Consideration (be emphatic -- right ideas should be stressed on)
5. Correctness (accuracy) - no rumors, no bias and no grammatical errors. It should be exact and correct.
6. Concreteness - It should be to the point supported by facts and figures in a very easy language.
7. Courtesy - This implies that both sender and receiver should have good terms with each other so as to understand each other's thoughts and feelings and respect them.
