I"~<p>Damn, I missed that time of year where everybody makes a new year resolution. I’m just kidding. I enjoyed my new year even though I don’t remember what I did that day. One thing I’m sure is that I didn’t make any <em>new year resolution</em> on that day because I never complete my new year resolutions.</p>

<p>It is said that new year is the perfect time to regain focus on what you truly want in life. But for me that statement is never true. I don’t know what I want in life. I’m just enjoying my present time looking at the computer screen most of the time.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that this year will bring some joy to my life. To make sure that this joy comes I’m <strong>challenging</strong> myself to do some task. Some task might be tough and some might seem easy. But these task are some of those that I hope I enjoy doing it. Here goes my challenge to myself for the <em>2017</em>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>learn a new language</li>
  <li>complete the project</li>
  <li>start a youtube channel(can be of any type)</li>
  <li>make atlease one youtube video weekly
(which by the way if you love tech, subscribe to my channel, I might add some videos in future <strong><em>wink</em></strong> <strong><em>wink</em></strong>) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheAdd10">TheAdd10</a></li>
  <li>go visit some more places outside the valley</li>
</ul>
