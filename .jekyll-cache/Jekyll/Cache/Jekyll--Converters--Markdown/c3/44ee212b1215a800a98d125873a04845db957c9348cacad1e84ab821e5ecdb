I"È<p>Have you ever wondered whether ruby has one liner server command equivalent to the python ?
Turns out there is a similar command for ruby also.</p>

<p>Open your terminal, go to your desired directory where you want to run the server and enter the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">ruby -run -e httpd . -p 5000
</code></pre>

<p>It will start a webserver runnning on your machine at port 5000. No extra gem is needed for this to run.</p>
