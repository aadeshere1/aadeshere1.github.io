I"{<p>Iâ€™ve had trouble with <code class="highlighter-rouge">matplotlib</code> while running a python script.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
...
...

plt.show()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This bit of code was supposed to show the graph of the image defined but when I ran the code, nothing happened. No errors, no program run. So, I searched on internet and found the solution to it as first including <code class="highlighter-rouge">PyQt5 and matplotlib</code> in the beginning and then <code class="highlighter-rouge">use('qt5agg')</code></p>
