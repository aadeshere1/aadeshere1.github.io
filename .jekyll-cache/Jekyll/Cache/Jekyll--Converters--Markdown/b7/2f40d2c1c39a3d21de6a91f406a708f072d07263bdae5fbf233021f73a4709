I"-<p>Iâ€™ve had trouble with <code>matplotlib</code> while running a python script.</p>

<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
...
...

plt.show()
</code></pre>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"># We give it the key and we get the value
people[&quot;Jake&quot;]
=&gt; 30

# We can assign the value of the key to something else
people[&quot;Jake&quot;] = 100

# Now the value is 100 (it used to be 30)
people[&quot;Jake&quot;]
=&gt; 100</code></pre></figure>

<p>This bit of code was supposed to show the graph of the image defined but when I ran the code, nothing happened. No errors, no program run. So, I searched on internet and found the solution to it as first including <code>PyQt5 and matplotlib</code> in the beginning and then <code>use('qt5agg')</code></p>
